# cybersecurity-Task-2

 **Objective**:
 Identify phishing characteristics in a suspicious email sample.

**Tools Used**:
mxtoolbox ( For Header Analysis)[https://mxtoolbox.com/EmailHeaders.aspx]

**Email- 1**:
- PayPal Phishing Email (self created)

*Phishing-indicators*
- Spoofed email address: service-update@secure-paypal.com is fake.
- Urgent language: "Your immediate attention is required", "permanent account suspension".
- Fake link: Looks like PayPal but is actually paypal-update-verification.com — which is malicious.
- Generic greeting: No name or user ID — real PayPal emails usually personalize messages.
- Threatening tone: Tries to scare the user into acting quickly.

**Email-2**:
- Microsoft Phishing Email (Google Sample)

*Phishing-indicator*

- Fake sender domain: 	@msupdate.net is not a Microsoft domain
- Generic greeting:	 No user name or personalization
- Emotional trigger	“Your account has been compromised” creates panic
- Urgent instructions	Asking user to quickly reset password and review security
- Fake links (potential)	Hovering over links might lead to phishing sites

**Email-3**:
- Apollo  Phishing Email (Google Sample)

*Phishing-indicator*

- that the sender's email domain is spelled incorrectly
- that the link URL is not pointing to @Apollo's website
- poor language, spelling and grammar
- low quality, pixelated graphics


**Conclusion**
## ✅ Conclusion

Through the analysis of multiple phishing email samples, this task has demonstrated how cybercriminals craft deceptive messages to manipulate recipients into revealing sensitive information or taking harmful actions.

Across the examined emails, the following common phishing characteristics were identified:

- **Spoofed sender addresses** that mimic legitimate services (e.g., PayPal, Microsoft).
- **Urgent or alarming language** designed to create panic and force quick reactions.
- **Fake or misleading URLs** that appear legitimate but redirect to malicious websites.
- **Poor grammar, formatting errors, and generic greetings** that reduce authenticity.
- **Lack of proper authentication mechanisms** like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC in email headers.

These traits help attackers exploit human trust and technical weaknesses to gain unauthorized access or deliver malware.

Understanding and identifying these patterns is critical for building strong email security awareness and preventing phishing attacks. Regular analysis, use of email security tools, and user education remain the best defenses against such threats.

This task improved my skills in:
- Reading and analyzing email headers
- Spotting social engineering attempts
- Using tools like MXToolbox
- Structuring and documenting phishing analysis for cybersecurity reporting
